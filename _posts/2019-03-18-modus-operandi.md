I learned, actually yesterday, that I have Thinker type of teamworker, with Source-seeker splash. This means my forte is at coming up with new ideas while I typically am not good at implementing thm.

I also concluded that sugarless diet kills my energy. The irregularity creates many downer moment where I feel half asleep. I don't know what is the correct method for intermittent fasting or any other diet.
Generally I want to avoid the lows and loading up the fuel, so need to maintain one modus operandi with eating. More fruit and no alcohol however are good things. Need to keep them.

Some bands can create two/three albums per year... this is possible
