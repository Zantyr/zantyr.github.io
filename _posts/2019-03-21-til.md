I'm sleepy so I will keep it fast

1. I am really impressed by some people around me. I guess I should make myself more representative
and tactful to build a good network of acquaintances. I learned that you cannot be artificially
like that - you just need to be "OK" and to set yourself high standards. You don't need to be saint tho.

2. I learnt about some nasty people doing BD - like they know everything and care only about themselves.
This makes doing business with them a bad thing even when it would be profitable

3. I am constantly reminded of being easy to anger and eager to criticize. I don't know what to do further,
I don't really want to fight anymore with some things and I am told that I indeed do.

4. I am very tired. Generally I have no good plan for a diet that will give me energy but not overload
me with some shit. All experiments I tried leave me powerless and sleepy. Time to google some solution.
