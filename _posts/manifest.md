# What do I optimize for?

- Maximize the number of interesting ideas checked
  - Actual proof of concepts count only
  - This should guide my vocational choices - work and projects taken should prioritize novelty over money and concepts over products
  - This should guide choice of time spent - implement PoCs and present them somewhere, where people listen
  - Ideas should be novel, no reimplementations
- Life a healthy life to keep focused on important things
  - Maintain this log and other tools to stay organized and focus on
  - Workout; currently have to get a good shape
    - In order to do that - ergometer for a month daily (need to notify GF for commitment)
- Create music
  - better done that perfect
    - therefore choose simple medium and innovate within that simple medium (stoner/sludge)
  - music has to convey message that is overall beneficiary, has to MOVE people towards doing things
- Care about your family
  - you have small needs, so take utmost care for quality of the meetings, so they are rememberable
