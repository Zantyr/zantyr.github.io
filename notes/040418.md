Semi-productive day. Actually productivity on remote work is something to work on.
The other thing biting me is not having a clear method of ruling out what's wrong with the model, it's just pretty much guessing and exploring options of what may fail.
Checkig out Mastodon.

What I've learnt:

- Used Ones() initalizer to initialize forget bias in LSTM (as well as whole bias vector, which is not the best way to do it.) <- to validate
- Probably set up the DNS for this page. A records for IPv4, AAAA IPv6, main records provided by the provider (sic!) are for DNS propagation things
- STFT in Python is actually quite slow when done multiple times, using EM to minimize error given parameters to model working on vowel detection may be good substitution for NN, but the fitting time is outrageous and cannot get really good results.

Planning to do:

- check out FST composition in `pywrapfst` - cannot manage to compose L and G models I've constructed and not sure, whether it is due to their (in)correctness or some library-specific magic.
- figure out how to improve my remote work performance
