Ideas:

Curiosity driven learning

Invariance-based superresolution and solving equation for "perfect" solutions. Can it be solved
analytically? We need to attract inputs and take outputs as the solution for the ResNet module.
And can we actually use the censored models for that?



Domain side measurements - given hidden activations in range [0-1], how far do the inputs span?
Generally we want features to be meaningfully generated in only subspace of inputs
