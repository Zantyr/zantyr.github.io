		This page exists as the best way of verifying one's knowledge is to explain it. I also want to store all my ideas and experiments in one place.

		On me - my primary want-to-be is to ask questions about state-of-the-art and solve interesting problems. As a hobby - doing music.
		I like patterns. I like delving deep. Solving problems (e.g. asking non-standard questions and proving their merit) and music (either listening or playing) are probably
		two most pleasurable activities.

		I am not bullshit-intolerant, but I try to simplify as much as I can. Good things are simple. If they are complicated, they are good if made from simple things.
		I am quite understanding, because understanding is better than pretty much any fight as usually "people know better".
	</p>
	<p>
		I dislike assuming that one knows best unless the facts speak for themselves. However hybris is basis to actually knowing best in the future, so 
		I would actually encourage people to <i>think</i> they <i>may</i> know better, but not claim it before proven right.

		People change, depending on many factors. One unchanging thing is that people change. Expect this page to change as well.
