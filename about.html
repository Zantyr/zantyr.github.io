		This page exists as the best way of verifying one's knowledge is to teach it. I'd be glad if someone finds material here useful.

		As for me, I am naturally curious and impatient individual who wants to create useful things. I like interesting people, math-like patterns, trivia and to some small degree musicianship and theatre. 
		I dislike ungratefulness and lack of will to undestand.
